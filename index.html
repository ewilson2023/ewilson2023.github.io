						<div class="p_container">
							<p> 
							I was born in Ottawa. At home, I live with my parents, my
							younger brother and sister, and my two dogs.
							</p>
						</div>
					<h3>Early Education</h3>
						<div class="p_container">
							<p> 
							After high school I studied history at the University
							of Ottawa for two years. Eventually, I realised I hated writing
							essays and switched to Algonquin College for 
							Concept Art &amp Illustration, a three semester program. I was
							near the top of the class.

					<h3>Work</h3>
						<div class="p_container">
							<p>
							I made friends and connections at Algonquin that led
							to work in the art industry. Most of my work was low-paying
							commissions until 2019, when I was hired by Kindly Beast,
							a game development studio based in Ottawa. It paid well and
							I loved working there, but it closed less than a year later.
							</p><p>
							I would link my portfolio but it's not public right now because
							I stopped giving adobe any of my money.
							</p>
						</div>
					<h3>Covid-19</h3>
						<div class="p_container">
							<p>
							Covid hit a few months later. I was commissed by Apple UK
							to make art for the app store's "Today Tab", but otherwise,
							I didn't do much of anything.
							</p><p>
							In summer 2022, I used the money from Kindly Beast to go on a solo
							trip to Ireland, where my grandparents were born. I was there for almost two months.
							</p>

						<p>
						I loved Ireland so much I wanted to try living there, but I
						had no reliable way to 
						support myself.	I was already burnt out from the art industry 
						and was ready to leave it for something more stable. I chose 
						to study computer science, something I had limited exposure to,
						but felt I had an apitutude for. I started attending Bishop's
						in 2023.
