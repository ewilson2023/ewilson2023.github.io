		<h2>Past</h2>
			<h3>Early Life</h3>
				<p> 
					I was born in Ottawa. At home, I live with my parents, my
					younger brother and sister, and my two dogs.
				</p>
			<h3>Early Education</h3>
				<p>
					After high school I studied history at the University
					of Ottawa for two years. Eventually, I realised I hated writing
					essays and switched to Algonquin College for 
					Concept Art &amp Illustration, a three semester program. I was
					near the top of the class.

			<h3>Work</h3>
				<p>
					I made friends and connections at Algonquin that led
					to work in the art industry. Most of my work was low-paying
					commissions until 2019, when I was hired by Kindly Beast,
					a game development studio based in Ottawa. It paid well and
					I loved working there, but it closed less than a year later.
					<br>
					I would link my portfolio but I stopped giving adobe 
					any of my money.
				</p>
			<h3>Covid-19</h3>
				<p>
					Covid hit a few months later. I was commissed by Apple UK
					to make art for the app store's "Today Tab", but otherwise,
					I didn't do much of anything.
					<br>
					In summer 2022, I used the money from Kindly Beast to go on a solo
					trip to Ireland, where my grandparents were born. I was there for almost two months.
				</p>
				
			<h2>Present</h2>
				<p>
					I loved Ireland so much I wanted to try living there, but I
					had no reliable way to 
					support myself.	I was already burnt out from the art industry 
					and was ready to leave it for something more stable. I chose 
					to study computer science, something I had limited exposure to,
					but felt I had of an apitutude for. I started attending Bishop's
					in 2023.
